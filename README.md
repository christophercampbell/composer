#### Option Monad in Go
A simple implementation of the Option monad in Go, inspired by Scala's Option[T]. This library provides a way to handle computations that may fail without resorting to heavy error handling, using Go's generics introduced in Go 1.18.

#### Introduction
This library implements the Option monad pattern in Go, allowing developers to write code that can gracefully handle operations that might fail (such as parsing, division by zero, etc.) without explicit error checking after each operation. It leverages Go's generics to provide a type-safe way to work with optional values.

#### Features
- Option Monad: Represents a value that may or may not be present.
- Some and None Constructors: Easily create Option instances.
- Functional Operations: Use FlatMap and Map to chain computations.
- Type-Safe: Leverages Go's generics for type safety.
- No External Dependencies: Pure Go implementation.
